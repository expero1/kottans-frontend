# Kottans frontend course working diary
## Greating
Hi. My name is Eugene. I am interested in web development.
Nowdays I am learning JavaScript, React JS, HTML and CSS.
Also I learn python and SQL for Backend purposes.
And little bit of PHP.
When I read news about opening [Kottans frontend course](https://github.com/kottans/frontend), I wanted to participate this challenge.
And even if I will not go on Stage 1, I will try to finish full course and get new  knowledge  about web development.
